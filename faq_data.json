Then disposition as 'Not In' or as per project instructions for when the specific voter is unavailable.\n\nIf the script has **NO specific voter name** to begin with (truly assumptive or non-voter), and you simply start with a general greeting, then you can speak with whomever answers.\n\nPatches are often Voter Assumptive in their opening style, but if a specific target name is provided by the system for that patch, you must ensure you are connecting that named individual."

        "WRONG NUMBER": "Say, “We will update our records. Thank you for your time.”",
        "ANSWERING MACHINE": "Select this as soon as you hear any robotic voice. Delaying in these cases will get you flagged for “sitting on answering machines”. If you hear a fax tone, also use 'Answering Machine'.",
        "NO ANSWER": "Use this if the call is hung up immediately, or before getting an answer to Q1. Note: There are GOTV (Get Out The Vote) Projects where there is no question 1, or where 'No Answer' might have special coding like 'COMPLETE LIVE' - always follow project-specific instructions.",
        "DO NOT CALL": "Important: We almost never use this Disposition. Only use this if you have confirmed you are speaking with the VOF (Voter On File) AND they specifically ask to be “added” to the Do Not Call List. Most of the time, if they ask to be “removed” from the call list, that would be marked as 'REFUSED' (go to Next page and Disposition from there).",
        "COMPLETE PATCH": "Use this if you got a “Yes” to being connected to their Representative AND read the entire closing statement. If a page comes up asking for call results, always select option 1 on that page, go to the next page, and Complete the patch without waiting to listen to them leave their message.",
        "UNSUCCESSFUL PATCH": "PLACEHOLDER - [Instructions for when a patch attempt does not succeed, e.g., line busy, no answer from representative, voter hangs up during patch attempt, etc.]",
        "LANGUAGE BARRIER": "If they speak any language other than English, say “We will have someone call you back who speaks Spanish. Thank you for your time.” Then code as 'Language Barrier'.",
        "DECEASED": "If informed the contact is deceased, say, “We will update our records. Thank you for your time.” Then code as 'Deceased'.",
        "NOT IN": "This is not for 'Not Interested'. Use this if the VOF (Voter On File) cannot come to the phone for any reason. Say, “We will try again later. Thank you for your time.” Then code as 'Not In'.",
        "REFUSED": "Code as refused when they refuse a question or patch once the call has begun."

    "fallback_message": "I'm sorry, I couldn't find an answer for that specific query. Try typing for example 'list codes', 'common rebuttals', 'what is wrap up time', 'how can I reduce my wrap up time' or 'steps for a patch call'. You can also type 'pronounce [word]' to look up a pronunciation."
